# AWS Well-Architected Labs

## Introduction

The [Well-Architected](http://aws.amazon.com/well-architected) framework has been developed to help cloud architects build the most secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure possible for their applications. This framework provides a consistent approach for customers and partners to evaluate architectures, and provides guidance to help implement designs that will scale with your application needs over time.

This repository contains documentation and code in the format of hands-on labs to help you learn, measure, and build using architectural best practices. The labs are categorized into levels, where 100 is introductory, 200/300 is intermediate and 400 is advanced.

## Prerequisites:
An [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) that you are able to use for testing, that is not used for production or other purposes. 
NOTE: You will be billed for any applicable AWS resources used if you complete this lab that are not covered in the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).
